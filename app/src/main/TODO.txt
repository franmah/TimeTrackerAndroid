TODO:


TEST:
-> add some real tests for addTaskDatabase

DATABASE:

TASKS DISPLAY:
-> only display the total duration for the day

Graph Activity
-> improve chart loading (speed and showing the load animation)

CHARTS fragment
-> change the chart logic (pie/column) to have an interface with a function to get a graph.
(avoid having to modify each fragment every time), create a single async function if possible

Persistence:
-> updating time for running activities when going back into the app
-> to hold onto data: use lifecycle, is doesn't work then uses shared preferences.

Notifications:
-> permanent notification to easily access app
-> be able to stop an activity.
-> notification from locked screen, ability to get right to the app

SETTINGS:
-> select if app should keep running when app is destroyed?
->
