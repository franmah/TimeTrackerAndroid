Graph Activity
-> replace buttons by "<<< SWIPE >>>" with animation for the arrows
-> improve chart loading (speed and showing the load animation)

CHARTS fragment
-> change the chart logic (pie/column) to have an interface with a function to get a graph.
(avoid having to modify each fragment every time), create a single async function if possible

Persistence:
-> no stopping activities when app is left (or view) is left.
-> updating time for running activities when going back into the app
-> to hold onto data: use lifecycle, is doesn't work then uses shared preferences.

Notifications:
-> permanent notification to easily access app
-> be able to stop an activity.
-> notification from locked screen, ability to get right to the app

Performance:

=> 30 day caching?
pre-load data for the last 30 days into a Map<String (date), List<PairTime>
if selection is further back in time than 30 days then access DB.
